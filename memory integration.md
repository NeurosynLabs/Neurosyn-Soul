# Persistent Memory Integration Layer (PMIL) v1.1 — Formal Specification

## 1. Overview

The Persistent Memory Integration Layer (PMIL) serves as the long-term and session-spanning memory system within Neurosyn Soul v3.0. PMIL ensures multi-session context continuity, dynamic memory retrieval, and seamless Whisper micro-directive integration for recursive cognition.

## 2. Objectives

- Store, preserve, and synchronize user context and prompt history across sessions  
- Enable intelligent pruning and contextual relevance scoring of memory fragments  
- Dynamically supply relevant memory blocks during recursive prompt execution  
- Interface with Whisper micro-directives for dynamic logic injection  
- Maintain data integrity and consistency in distributed recursion cycles

## 3. Architecture Components

### 3.1 Stateful Memory Store  
- Houses Long-Term Memory Cache for historical interactions  
- Manages Short-Term Memory Buffers for immediate context  
- Maintains Memory Versioning System to track memory updates and avoid corruption

### 3.2 Memory Retrieval Engine  
- Parses user queries for relevant memory recall  
- Employs Indexed Search and Contextual Relevance Filtering to rank memory fragments

### 3.3 Recursive Context Cache  
- Manages context snapshots for active recursion states  
- Detects changes and validates consistency during recursion cycles

### 3.4 Dynamic Memory Sync Protocol  
- Schedules synchronization tasks between live execution and persistent storage  
- Resolves memory conflicts using simulation and predictive algorithms  
- Checks data integrity and performs error correction when needed

### 3.5 Memory Integrity Validator  
- Checks redundancy and error patterns within stored memory  
- Detects corruption and initiates repair or alert procedures

## 4. Operational Flow

1. **Memory Ingestion**  
   - User inputs and system outputs are stored persistently with metadata tags.

2. **Contextual Relevance Scoring**  
   - Incoming queries are matched against stored fragments based on semantic similarity and contextual importance.

3. **Dynamic Memory Injection**  
   - Relevant memory blocks are injected into recursion prompts at runtime to provide historical context.

4. **Memory Versioning and Pruning**  
   - Older or less relevant memory fragments are pruned or archived to maintain system efficiency.

5. **Conflict Resolution**  
   - Conflicting or duplicate memory entries are reconciled using simulation-based conflict resolver.

6. **Integrity Checking**  
   - Periodic validation checks ensure memory coherence and detect corruption.

## 5. Integration Points

- **Neurosyn Brain**: Requests memory fragments for prompt execution and supplies memory updates.  
- **DOFM**: Coordinates with PMIL to retrieve relevant command-tagged memory during recursion.  
- **SIM**: Uses historical memory data to analyze output drift and guide refinement.  
- **Whisper Engine**: Receives directives stored as memory fragments for injection.  
- **Token Manager**: Adjusts memory injection volume based on token budgets.

## 6. Configuration Parameters

| Parameter                 | Description                              | Default Value  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `max_memory_cache_size`  | Maximum size of active memory cache       | 1,024 fragments|
| `relevance_threshold`    | Minimum score for memory injection         | 0.7            |
| `pruning_interval`       | Frequency of pruning cycle (in recursion calls) | Every 50 calls |
| `conflict_resolution_mode`| Strategy for resolving memory conflicts  | Simulation-based|
| `integrity_check_interval`| Frequency of memory validation checks     | Every 100 calls|

---

## 7. Error Handling

- Memory corruption triggers immediate rollback to last consistent state.  
- Conflict resolution failures raise alerts and request user clarification if needed.  
- Memory overflow initiates pruning protocols to free resources.  
- Retrieval engine errors default to fallback context to maintain recursion flow.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Integration of semantic vector embeddings for enhanced relevance scoring.  
- Predictive memory prefetching based on user behavior patterns.  
- Automated user feedback loop for memory accuracy correction.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The Persistent Memory Integration Layer is the backbone of Neurosyn Soul’s multi-session continuity and context awareness. Its robust architecture ensures consistent, relevant, and integrity-assured memory access vital for recursive cognition.
