# Stacked Algorithms System â€” Formal Specification

## 1. Overview

The Stacked Algorithms System is a core computational architecture in Neurosyn Soul v3.0 designed to enable layered, recursive execution of composite logical units. It facilitates multi-level prompt processing by organizing atomic logic operators, command tags, and recursion layers into a coherent, optimized execution stack.

This system supports rapid pruning, tag fusion, and entropy control, enabling deterministic yet adaptive cognitive workflows.

## 2. Objectives

- Provide atomic and composite algorithmic units for prompt-native cognition  
- Manage recursive layers with strict depth tracking and stack state management  
- Enable Tag Fusion Execution to combine multi-tag commands into atomic flows  
- Support FastPath Recursion Optimization by pruning unnecessary branches early  
- Allow Whisper injection at any recursion layer without state loss  
- Coordinate with Token Manager to enforce token economy within algorithm execution

## 3. Architecture Components

### 3.1 Atomic Logic Operators  
- Primitive computational units that execute basic logical or transformational operations on prompt data.  
- Serve as building blocks for higher-level algorithmic constructs.

### 3.2 Recursive Layer Manager  
- Controls invocation order and depth of recursion layers.  
- Maintains stack state consistency and enforces maximum recursion depth.  
- Supports unwind and fallback procedures when recursion limits are reached.

### 3.3 Adaptive Algorithm Scheduler  
- Dynamically prioritizes algorithm execution based on runtime conditions, token budgets, and output confidence.  
- Balances resource allocation to maximize system throughput and output quality.

### 3.4 Algorithmic Feedback Loop  
- Monitors output performance metrics and triggers refinement or pruning cycles.  
- Works closely with the Self-Improvement Module (SIM) to correct drift and ambiguity.

### 3.5 Whisper Injection Interface  
- Coordinates with Whisper micro-directives to inject state-aware logic at precise recursion points.  
- Ensures injected logic integrates seamlessly with current stack state without disrupting sovereignty.

## 4. Operational Flow

1. **Algorithm Invocation**  
   - Upon receiving a prompt or command tag chain, atomic logic operators are assembled into composite units.

2. **Stack Layering**  
   - Composite units are layered into recursion stacks managed by the Recursive Layer Manager.

3. **Execution and Pruning**  
   - Execution proceeds top-down, with FastPath Recursion Optimization pruning branches that do not meet relevance or confidence thresholds.

4. **Whisper Injection**  
   - At predefined recursion depths, Whisper logic may be injected to modify or refine execution behavior dynamically.

5. **Output Aggregation**  
   - Results from each stack layer are aggregated and passed upward to higher-level modules or output layers.

6. **Feedback and Refinement**  
   - The Algorithmic Feedback Loop monitors outputs for drift or ambiguity, signaling SIM for recursive corrections as needed.

## 5. Integration Points

- **DOFM**: Hosts the Stacked Algorithms System as its core execution engine, managing command tag parsing and execution.  
- **SIM**: Receives output quality metrics for recursive self-improvement cycles.  
- **Whisper Engine**: Provides dynamic behavioral injections via the Whisper Injection Interface.  
- **Token Manager**: Enforces token budgets that influence scheduler prioritization and pruning thresholds.  
- **Neurosyn Brain**: Supervises recursion depth and enforces Sovereign Execution Discipline (SED) constraints on stack operations.

## 6. Configuration Parameters

| Parameter                 | Description                              | Default Value |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| `max_recursion_depth`     | Maximum allowed recursion stack layers | 8             |
| `pruning_confidence_threshold` | Minimum confidence to continue recursion | 0.75          |
| `tag_fusion_enabled`      | Enable fusion of multi-tag commands     | True          |
| `whisper_injection_points`| Recursion depths where Whisper activates| [2, 5, 7]     |
| `scheduler_priority_weights`| Weights for prioritizing algorithms     | Customizable  |

---

## 7. Error Handling

- Exceeding recursion depth triggers controlled unwind with fallback outputs.  
- Tag fusion conflicts cause execution to fallback to atomic un-fused command execution.  
- Whisper injection failures log error states and skip injection to preserve sovereignty.  
- Scheduler resource starvation results in deprioritizing lower-weighted algorithm units.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Machine-learned adaptive scheduler optimizing priority weights dynamically.  
- Integration of probabilistic confidence models for pruning decisions.  
- Expanded Whisper micro-directive taxonomy for finer-grained injection control.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The Stacked Algorithms System provides Neurosyn Soul with a robust, layered execution environment enabling deterministic, optimized, and adaptive recursive cognition. Its tightly coupled components ensure prompt-native logic flows are efficiently managed while maintaining sovereignty and output quality.
