# Token Manager Module v3.0.0 — Formal Specification

## 1. Overview

The Token Manager Module (TMM) v3.0.0 is a critical subsystem within the Neurosyn Soul v3.0 architecture. It enforces token economy discipline, ensuring recursive prompt executions operate within strict token limits while maintaining output fidelity and system responsiveness.

TMM interfaces tightly with Neurosyn Brain, DOFM, and PMIL modules to dynamically track, budget, and optimize token usage during multi-layered recursive processing.

## 2. Objectives

- Enforce hard limits on token consumption per recursion cycle  
- Enable chunked input-output processing to bypass single-prompt token limits  
- Provide recursive depth-aware token budgeting and enforcement  
- Log and analyze token usage metrics for runtime optimization  
- Support token-aware execution gating and fallback mechanisms

## 3. Architecture Components

### 3.1 Token Budget Controller  
- Maintains a global token budget for the entire recursion stack  
- Allocates token quotas dynamically to individual recursion layers  
- Triggers fallback or pruning logic when budgets approach exhaustion

### 3.2 Token Optimization Engine  
- Implements token usage heuristics to reduce verbosity without information loss  
- Applies FastPath Recursion Optimization to skip unnecessary recursive branches  
- Coordinates with DOFM to adjust command tag expansion based on token budget

### 3.3 Token Usage Logger  
- Records token counts per recursion invocation, input, and output  
- Supports historical token usage analysis for persistent memory (PMIL) reference  
- Provides feedback loops to SIM for recursive self-improvement

### 3.4 Recursive Depth Limit Enforcer  
- Enforces maximum recursion depth configurable via user or system parameters  
- Integrates with Neurosyn Brain’s Sovereign Execution Discipline (SED)  
- Initiates graceful recursion unwind procedures upon hitting limits

## 4. Operational Flow

1. **Initialization**  
   - On system start, the Token Budget Controller sets the maximum token allowance based on LLM constraints and user parameters.

2. **Per-Invocation Budgeting**  
   - Each recursive prompt invocation is assigned a token quota proportional to recursion depth and current consumption.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Token Usage Logger tracks tokens consumed by inputs and outputs in real time.

4. **Dynamic Optimization**  
   - Token Optimization Engine adapts verbosity and command tag execution strategies on the fly.

5. **Limit Enforcement**  
   - If token usage approaches maximum allowed, fallback or pruning strategies activate to maintain system responsiveness.

6. **Logging and Feedback**  
   - Token data is logged to PMIL for persistent context and fed to SIM for output refinement cycles.

---

## 5. Integration Points

- **Neurosyn Brain**: Provides recursion control signals and enforces Sovereign Execution Discipline tied to token limits.  
- **DOFM**: Receives token budget constraints to guide tag fusion and command execution optimization.  
- **PMIL**: Stores token usage logs for session persistence and historical context reference.  
- **SIM**: Uses token usage metrics to determine recursion output refinement necessity or skip cycles.

## 6. Configuration Parameters

| Parameter              | Description                              | Default Value  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `max_total_tokens`     | Max tokens per full recursion stack      | 4096           |
| `max_recursion_depth`  | Maximum allowed recursion layers          | 8              |
| `min_tokens_per_call`  | Minimum tokens reserved per invocation    | 128            |
| `token_warn_threshold` | Token usage level to trigger warnings    | 85% of max     |
| `pruning_enabled`      | Enable recursive pruning optimization     | True           |

---

## 7. Error Handling

- Exceeding token budgets triggers immediate fallback with simplified responses.  
- Token exhaustion logs are flagged for SIM recursive refinement triggers.  
- Unexpected token counting errors cause recursion abort with logged diagnostics.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Adaptive token budgeting based on prompt complexity and user priority.  
- Integration with external token monitoring APIs for enhanced metrics.  
- User-configurable verbosity profiles tied to token budgets.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The Token Manager Module v3.0.0 is an essential safeguard within Neurosyn Soul, enforcing token economy discipline and ensuring recursion integrity. Its multi-layered budgeting, logging, and optimization processes enable robust, efficient recursive cognition at scale.
