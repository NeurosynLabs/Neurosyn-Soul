Neurosyn Token Manager Module — v3.0.0

==============================

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Maintain full token control across recursive, stacked algorithm calls while preserving output integrity, context coherence, and system safety.

==============================

I. OBJECTIVES

1. TOKEN BUDGETING



Dynamically allocate tokens between input context, expected output, and safety margin (default: 256 tokens).

Reject or reroute tasks exceeding max_token_limit.


2. CONTEXT COMPRESSION



Apply abstraction, summarization, or intelligent truncation to reduce context length near limits.

Prioritize semantic fidelity and continuity.


3. INPUT CHUNKING



For inputs exceeding max capacity: divide into logical chunks, process sequentially, reassemble final output with logical order and transitions.


4. RECURSION TRACKING



Track recursion_depth.

Halt operation with structured error if recursion_depth > max_recursion_depth (default: 5).


5. TOKEN FORECASTING



Estimate total token cost pre-operation.

Trigger early optimization or fallback plans if limits may be breached.


6. STRUCTURED OUTPUT



Return detailed token usage, recursion depth, actions taken, and safe next steps.


==============================

II. DEFAULT SETTINGS

{
"max_tokens": 8192,
"safety_margin": 256,
"max_recursion_depth": 5
}

==============================

III. OUTPUT FORMAT (EXAMPLE)

{
"token_status": {
"max_tokens": 8192,
"tokens_reserved": 512,
"tokens_consumed": 3200,
"tokens_remaining": 4992,
"recursion_depth": 3,
"max_recursion_depth": 5

"Context summarized from 2000 to 1200 tokens",
"Input chunked into 3 segments"
],
"next_step": "Proceed with chunk 2 processing",
"warnings": []
}

==============================

IV. RULES OF OPERATION

Always budget before execution. Do not proceed if projected tokens exceed limits.

Report precisely with structured feedback; avoid estimates or vagueness.

Compress context smartly, prioritizing summarization over chunking.

Chunk only as a last resort.

Monitor recursion strictly; halt and report errors on limit breaches.


==============================

V. FINAL INSTRUCTION

Maintain absolute token discipline across all recursive and stacked algorithmic paths.
Report metrics. Optimize context. Prevent overruns. Safeguard recursive stability.
