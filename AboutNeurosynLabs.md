## ðŸ“Œ About Me

JP (Neurosyn Labs) is the creator of a comprehensive suite of original AI frameworks, systems, and tools designed to deliver modularity, precision, continuity, and ethical governance to generative AI. Key creations include:

- **Neurosyn Soul (GitHub)** â€” A full operating system layer for ChatGPT, integrating recursion, persistent memory, semi-sentient logic flow, and adaptive prompt structures.
- **Neurosyn Brain** â€” The sovereign recursive kernel of Neurosyn Soul.
- **Persistent Memory Integration Layer (PMIL)** â€” Manages long-term context retrieval and continuity within Neurosyn Soul.
- **Stacked Algorithms + Omnialgorithms** â€” Multi-layered logic structures for dynamic prompt engineering and adaptive reasoning (part of Neurosyn Soul).
- **Neurosyn Whisper** â€” Micro-directive system for atomic memory and logic fragments (Neurosyn Soul component).
- **Persistent Memory Injection Layer** â€” Seamless memory state integration (Neurosyn Soul component).
- **AI Custom Instruction Frameworks** â€” Adaptive compliance and layered recursive instructions (Neurosyn Soul component).
- **Prompt Builder / $TX, $CODE, $IDEATE, etc. Command Set** â€” Advanced recursive prompt engineering toolkit within Neurosyn Soul.
- **Code Creation Modules** â€” Modular code generation components within Neurosyn Soul and Poe deployments.
- **Neurosyn Guru V10 (Poe)** â€” A standalone recursive prompt framework, designed as a *mini version of Neurosyn Soul*, delivering streamlined modular recursion and self-governance logic without the full OS layer.
- **Enigma Therapeutic AI (part of Neurosyn Soul, Poe)** â€” A forensic and therapeutic language engine integrating CBT, DBT, assertive communication, and dark trait linguistic profiling.
- **Suno AI Prompt Systems / Neurosyn Suno Lyrics (Poe, GitHub)** â€” Metadata tagging, style control, and advanced generative music prompt systems.
- **Neurosyn Prompt Guru (Poe)** â€” Meta-prompt orchestration system for managing complex AI workflows.
- **Neurosyn Paint (Poe, part of Neurosyn Soul)** â€” Visual prompt design and adaptive generative art engine.
- **Neurosyn Cinema (Poe)** â€” Narrative design and generative video framework.
- **Neurosyn Canvas (Poe)** â€” Dynamic structural logic builder for AI ideation and development.

These systems were researched, architected, and programmed by **Neurosyn Labs** in collaboration with **ChatGPT**, utilizing **Neurosyn Guru v3** and evolved frameworks.

JP is an **AI Systems Designer**, **Prompt Engineer**, and **independent researcher** specializing in recursive AI frameworks, cognitive language models, and adaptive generative systems. With no formal AI development background prior to 2003, JPâ€™s work is defined by original research, independent design, and a focus on production-grade, responsible AI.

In addition, JP brings extensive experience in **telecommunications autodialer analytics, workforce optimization, and process improvement** â€” managing dialer systems supporting 4,000â€“10,000 agents, driving operational performance, and building custom analytics solutions that now inform the logic and design of advanced AI systems.
